# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Two Box Development

Two box development separates editing, compiling and linking from executing. One box runs an editor, cross-compiler, so-called because it compiles for a different machine architecture than the one on which it runs, and link-editor, which binds together the various parts of your program.

After compilation the program is loaded from the first box to the second which executes it. To make this possible the box on which the program executes has a boot loader that runs automatically whenever it is rebooted. The boot loader, called RedBoot, is an offshoot of a real-time development environment called ecos.

Its prompt is ```RedBoot>. ```

There are two commands you care about
1. load, which loads a file from the internet.
2. go, which puts the load address into the program counter.

Actually there are four boxes we care about

1. The box on which you edit, compile and link the code
2. The box that executes the code
3. The box that displays output from and provides keyboard input to a serial port (com2) on the second box.
4. The box that transforms its inout and output (from the other serial port (com1) on the second box into train commands

Box 1 is connected to box 2 by ethernet.

Box 2 is connected to box 3 by three-wire RS-232.

Box 2 is connected to box 4 by five-wire RS-232.

Box 2 is the primary focus of the first half of the course. It contains
* A Cirrus 9304 system on chip, which contains among other devices,
    * an ARM 920T cpu, executing the v4 ARM architecture,
    * two UARTS (driving com1 and com2),
    * a variety of timers, and
    * an ethernet adapter.
* thirty-two MBytes of DRAM,
* flash memory containing a boot loader, and
* various connectors.


## Serial I/O

All four boxes are used in assignment 0, the focus of which is getting box 2 communicating with the other three boxes.

In order to do assignment zero your program, running on box 2, must

1. receive keyboard input from the terminal (box 3),
2. send monitor output to the terminal (box 3),
3. send commands to the train controller (box 4),
4. receive sensor reports from the train (box 4), and
5. read the timer (box 2) to update the clock.

The first four use serial I/O for communication, so you must start assignment zero by mastering the hardware and software that provides getc and putc in a Unix environment.
Uses a device called a UART,

* which is really just two shift registers,
    * one for receiving and
    * one for sending,
* and a bus interface of two eight-bit read/write registers,
    * one for sending and receiving data and
    * one for writing commands and reading status.

For the purposes of assignment 0 this appears to your program as several registers, magic locations in memory.

1. Read from the data register to get a byte from the UART.
2. Write to the data register and the UART will transmit the byte.
3. Read from the status register to discover if a byte has been received or if the UART has finished transmitting the last byte written.


## Busy Waiting

Busy waiting is the simplest and most reliable way of timing an action, and is the technique used in the hello-world program. In addition it gives the shortest possible response time. (Except when more than one response time matters.)

```c++
#define FOREVER for( ; ; )
FOREVER {
    while( !ready( ) ) ;
    do-it( );
}
```
  
The above program is written in an easy-to-understand form. Real programs, not to mention real-time ones, are not easy to understand. A more realistic version looks more like this

```c++
#define UART1_BASE        0x808c0000
#define UART_DATA_OFFSET        0x00    // low 8 bits
#define UART_FLAG_OFFSET        0x18    // low 8 bits
#define TXFF_MASK               0x20    // Transmit buffer full

#define  FLAGS	(int *)( UART1_BASE | UART_FLAG_OFFSET )
#define DATA	(int *)( UART1_BASE | UART_DATA_OFFSET );

void transmit( byte c ) {
    while( ( FLAGS & TXFF_MASK ) ) ;
    DATA = c;
}
```
  
**The problem with busy-waiting**

What if the CPU has to two things at once?E.g.,

* collect bytes coming in a serial port
* maintain a clock

Unless the rate of bytes coming in and rate of clock ticks are identical you are guaranteed to lose something sooner or later. If this is not obvious work out an example in detail.


# Lecture 2: Polling Loops

## "Smart" terminals

In the late 1970s Digital Equipment Corporation (now part of HP by way of Compaq) introduced a "smart" terminal called the VT100; the feature that made it "smart" was cursor addressing. There were keys added to its keyboard each of which sent several characters at once. The first character was always ESCAPE, so these key sequences were called escape sequences. Each sequence moved the cursor in some way. Putting these sequences into editors created the first full-screen editors: such as ked, keyboard editor for RT-11, late 1970s.

The first escape codes moved the cursor around the display. They were used more often by programs than by users. (Many were programs executed by keyboards that made a single key press return two or more keystrokes.) Without cursor adderssing it was necessary to write 80 X 24 characters to make a change to the display, even if only 2 characters were changing. With cursor addressing an escape sequence could put the cursor in the right place after which the program can send the characters to be changed.

Escape sequences vary from one terminal program to another with a common core which is the set created for the VT100.

## Timers

There is one master clock, a crystal oscillator in a phase-locked loop. It is divided down to clock all the different parts of the computer. The frequency of a crystal oscillator is only precise to manufacturing tolerances. The master clock is a square wave signal, the edges of which latch data in clocked logic.

There are five counters available to you in the EP9302.

* a 40-bit cycle counter, which counts at the rate of the CPU clock
* two sixteen bit counters with programmable count rates
* one 32-bit counter with a programmable count rate
* one qwatch-dog timer.

None of them drives the time-of-day functions you see in an operating system. What is the ntp daemon?

In practice, how do you find out the time for a0? You watch for the overflow of a timer.

* load the starting value into the load register.
* start a timer -- probably the 32-bit one -- counting by setting the enable bit in the control/status register.
* read the count register -- fine for polling loop, not fine for your kernel
* each time you see -- what? -- you increment the time.

In practice, how do you know that you are keeping accurate time?

## Busy Waiting
This is used to synchronize with an external event, minimizing response time. This bit of code waits for something to be ready then does something as soon at whatever it is is ready. Then it waits for the same thing again and does the same action a second time.

```c++
#define FOREVER for( ; ; )

int ready( ) {
    return( *0xZZZZZZZZ & READY_BIT );
}

FOREVER {
    if ( ready( ) ) do-it( );
}
```
  
Actually, the code above does not necessarily work. Almost every compiler in the world converts the above code to
```c++
if ( ready( ) ) do-it( );
```

The compiler does not know that the value returned by ready( ) might change without an assignment somewhere in the code.

Note. The volatile keyword is one way of controlling the compiler. You can alternatively write assembly code or compile without optimiziation.

**Worst case response time**

The busy wait reponse time is very fast, But what if the CPU has to three things at once? For example,

1. receive bytes coming to one serial port,
2. receive bytes coming to another serial port, and
3. maintain a clock in the terminal window.

To understand this problem we need to do a little mental arithmetic to see, for example, how long the CPU would spend busy-waiting.

Digression: How many bits in a byte?**

* ASCII defines three character sets: 6-bit, 7-bit and 8-bit. 7-bit is the most common; 8-bit is better, but not completely standardized.
* The two UARTs must synchronize. This occurs as a result of the receiving UART searching for a start bit that starts every communication.
* To detect errors, which UARTs do there needs to be an end of transmission bit to put the UART back to searching for a start bit and a parity bit to catch 1-bit errors.
* The character set, the number of stop bits and the existence (or not) of a parity bit must be the same at both ends of the communication line. This is the main drawback of the UART as a device: the evil counterpart of its extreme robustness. Since UARTs are nowadays used only by experts, such as you, it's no longer a problem.

Four questions.

* How long does it take to transmit a byte to the train controller?
* How long does it take to receive a byte from the terminal?
* How often do you need to read the timer?
* What's the problem?

## Polling Loops

Polling loops allow you to manage more than one condition/activity pair at the same time.

The basic polling loop

```c++
FOREVER {
  if ( c1 ) a1;
  if ( c2 ) a2;
  ...
  if ( cN ) aN;
}
```

Worst case response time: 
* sum over n of {execution time of if( c<n> ) + execution time of a<n>}

What you put into an action matters a lot.

Suppose you put busy-wait I/O to the train controller into an action

Will you catch it in the testing you do? Probably not.

**Testing more than once**

Suppose you are getting events that trigger a1 too infrequently. Then try the loop

```c++
FOREVER {
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c2 ) a2;
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c3 ) a3;
    ...
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( cN ) aN;
    }
```
  
Worst case response time for a1
* execution time for if( c1 ) + maximum over n of execution time for if( cn ) an

**Breaking into pieces**

Suppose the response time is still too long, because the execution of one action, say a2, is too long. Then you can break a2 into two parts

```c++
FOREVER {
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c2 ) { a2.1; half-done = TRUE; }
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( half-done ) { a2.2; half-done = FALSE; }
    ...
}
```
  
When we are using interrupts this is called opening up an interrupt window.

This is strarting to get a little complicated and we haven't said anything about inter-action communication. How would you accomplish that?

## A few odds and ends about trains
1. Put a terminal between the ARM box and the train controller.
2. The three way switches are actually a pair of switches so they have four states
    * Straight/Straight: go straight through.
    * Straight/Curved: go onto one branch.
    * Curved/Straight: go onto the other branch.
    * Curved/Curved: Derail, but not every time.
3. Turning a train headlight on and off is an easy way to see if you are communicating with the train controller successfully.
