# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Two Box Development

Two box development separates editing, compiling and linking from executing. One box runs an editor, cross-compiler, so-called because it compiles for a different machine architecture than the one on which it runs, and link-editor, which binds together the various parts of your program.

After compilation the program is loaded from the first box to the second which executes it. To make this possible the box on which the program executes has a boot loader that runs automatically whenever it is rebooted. The boot loader, called RedBoot, is an offshoot of a real-time development environment called ecos.

Its prompt is ```RedBoot>. ```

There are two commands you care about
1. load, which loads a file from the internet.
2. go, which puts the load address into the program counter.

Actually there are four boxes we care about

1. The box on which you edit, compile and link the code
2. The box that executes the code
3. The box that displays output from and provides keyboard input to a serial port (com2) on the second box.
4. The box that transforms its inout and output (from the other serial port (com1) on the second box into train commands

Box 1 is connected to box 2 by ethernet.

Box 2 is connected to box 3 by three-wire RS-232.

Box 2 is connected to box 4 by five-wire RS-232.

Box 2 is the primary focus of the first half of the course. It contains
* A Cirrus 9304 system on chip, which contains among other devices,
    * an ARM 920T cpu, executing the v4 ARM architecture,
    * two UARTS (driving com1 and com2),
    * a variety of timers, and
    * an ethernet adapter.
* thirty-two MBytes of DRAM,
* flash memory containing a boot loader, and
* various connectors.


## Serial I/O

All four boxes are used in assignment 0, the focus of which is getting box 2 communicating with the other three boxes.

In order to do assignment zero your program, running on box 2, must

1. receive keyboard input from the terminal (box 3),
2. send monitor output to the terminal (box 3),
3. send commands to the train controller (box 4),
4. receive sensor reports from the train (box 4), and
5. read the timer (box 2) to update the clock.

The first four use serial I/O for communication, so you must start assignment zero by mastering the hardware and software that provides getc and putc in a Unix environment.
Uses a device called a UART,

* which is really just two shift registers,
    * one for receiving and
    * one for sending,
* and a bus interface of two eight-bit read/write registers,
    * one for sending and receiving data and
    * one for writing commands and reading status.

For the purposes of assignment 0 this appears to your program as several registers, magic locations in memory.

1. Read from the data register to get a byte from the UART.
2. Write to the data register and the UART will transmit the byte.
3. Read from the status register to discover if a byte has been received or if the UART has finished transmitting the last byte written.


## Busy Waiting

Busy waiting is the simplest and most reliable way of timing an action, and is the technique used in the hello-world program. In addition it gives the shortest possible response time. (Except when more than one response time matters.)

```c
#define FOREVER for( ; ; )
FOREVER {
    while( !ready( ) ) ;
    do-it( );
}
```
  
The above program is written in an easy-to-understand form. Real programs, not to mention real-time ones, are not easy to understand. A more realistic version looks more like this

```c
#define UART1_BASE        0x808c0000
#define UART_DATA_OFFSET        0x00    // low 8 bits
#define UART_FLAG_OFFSET        0x18    // low 8 bits
#define TXFF_MASK               0x20    // Transmit buffer full

#define  FLAGS	(int *)( UART1_BASE | UART_FLAG_OFFSET )
#define DATA	(int *)( UART1_BASE | UART_DATA_OFFSET );

void transmit( byte c ) {
    while( ( FLAGS & TXFF_MASK ) ) ;
    DATA = c;
}
```
  
**The problem with busy-waiting**

What if the CPU has to two things at once?E.g.,

* collect bytes coming in a serial port
* maintain a clock

Unless the rate of bytes coming in and rate of clock ticks are identical you are guaranteed to lose something sooner or later. If this is not obvious work out an example in detail.


# Lecture 2: Polling Loops

## "Smart" terminals

In the late 1970s Digital Equipment Corporation (now part of HP by way of Compaq) introduced a "smart" terminal called the VT100; the feature that made it "smart" was cursor addressing. There were keys added to its keyboard each of which sent several characters at once. The first character was always ESCAPE, so these key sequences were called escape sequences. Each sequence moved the cursor in some way. Putting these sequences into editors created the first full-screen editors: such as ked, keyboard editor for RT-11, late 1970s.

The first escape codes moved the cursor around the display. They were used more often by programs than by users. (Many were programs executed by keyboards that made a single key press return two or more keystrokes.) Without cursor adderssing it was necessary to write 80 X 24 characters to make a change to the display, even if only 2 characters were changing. With cursor addressing an escape sequence could put the cursor in the right place after which the program can send the characters to be changed.

Escape sequences vary from one terminal program to another with a common core which is the set created for the VT100.

## Timers

There is one master clock, a crystal oscillator in a phase-locked loop. It is divided down to clock all the different parts of the computer. The frequency of a crystal oscillator is only precise to manufacturing tolerances. The master clock is a square wave signal, the edges of which latch data in clocked logic.

There are five counters available to you in the EP9302.

* a 40-bit cycle counter, which counts at the rate of the CPU clock
* two sixteen bit counters with programmable count rates
* one 32-bit counter with a programmable count rate
* one qwatch-dog timer.

None of them drives the time-of-day functions you see in an operating system. What is the ntp daemon?

In practice, how do you find out the time for a0? You watch for the overflow of a timer.

* load the starting value into the load register.
* start a timer -- probably the 32-bit one -- counting by setting the enable bit in the control/status register.
* read the count register -- fine for polling loop, not fine for your kernel
* each time you see -- what? -- you increment the time.

In practice, how do you know that you are keeping accurate time?

## Busy Waiting
This is used to synchronize with an external event, minimizing response time. This bit of code waits for something to be ready then does something as soon at whatever it is is ready. Then it waits for the same thing again and does the same action a second time.

```c
#define FOREVER for( ; ; )

int ready( ) {
    return( *0xZZZZZZZZ & READY_BIT );
}

FOREVER {
    if ( ready( ) ) do-it( );
}
```
  
Actually, the code above does not necessarily work. Almost every compiler in the world converts the above code to
```c++
if ( ready( ) ) do-it( );
```

The compiler does not know that the value returned by ready( ) might change without an assignment somewhere in the code.

Note. The volatile keyword is one way of controlling the compiler. You can alternatively write assembly code or compile without optimiziation.

**Worst case response time**

The busy wait reponse time is very fast, But what if the CPU has to three things at once? For example,

1. receive bytes coming to one serial port,
2. receive bytes coming to another serial port, and
3. maintain a clock in the terminal window.

To understand this problem we need to do a little mental arithmetic to see, for example, how long the CPU would spend busy-waiting.

Digression: How many bits in a byte?**

* ASCII defines three character sets: 6-bit, 7-bit and 8-bit. 7-bit is the most common; 8-bit is better, but not completely standardized.
* The two UARTs must synchronize. This occurs as a result of the receiving UART searching for a start bit that starts every communication.
* To detect errors, which UARTs do there needs to be an end of transmission bit to put the UART back to searching for a start bit and a parity bit to catch 1-bit errors.
* The character set, the number of stop bits and the existence (or not) of a parity bit must be the same at both ends of the communication line. This is the main drawback of the UART as a device: the evil counterpart of its extreme robustness. Since UARTs are nowadays used only by experts, such as you, it's no longer a problem.

Four questions.

* How long does it take to transmit a byte to the train controller?
* How long does it take to receive a byte from the terminal?
* How often do you need to read the timer?
* What's the problem?

## Polling Loops

Polling loops allow you to manage more than one condition/activity pair at the same time.

The basic polling loop

```c
FOREVER {
  if ( c1 ) a1;
  if ( c2 ) a2;
  ...
  if ( cN ) aN;
}
```

Worst case response time: 
* sum over n of {execution time of if( c<n> ) + execution time of a<n>}

What you put into an action matters a lot.

Suppose you put busy-wait I/O to the train controller into an action

Will you catch it in the testing you do? Probably not.

**Testing more than once**

Suppose you are getting events that trigger a1 too infrequently. Then try the loop

```c
FOREVER {
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c2 ) a2;
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c3 ) a3;
    ...
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( cN ) aN;
    }
```
  
Worst case response time for a1
* execution time for if( c1 ) + maximum over n of execution time for if( cn ) an

**Breaking into pieces**

Suppose the response time is still too long, because the execution of one action, say a2, is too long. Then you can break a2 into two parts

```c
FOREVER {
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c2 ) { a2.1; half-done = TRUE; }
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( half-done ) { a2.2; half-done = FALSE; }
    ...
}
```
  
When we are using interrupts this is called opening up an interrupt window.

This is strarting to get a little complicated and we haven't said anything about inter-action communication. How would you accomplish that?

## A few odds and ends about trains
1. Put a terminal between the ARM box and the train controller.
2. The three way switches are actually a pair of switches so they have four states
    * Straight/Straight: go straight through.
    * Straight/Curved: go onto one branch.
    * Curved/Straight: go onto the other branch.
    * Curved/Curved: Derail, but not every time.
3. Turning a train headlight on and off is an easy way to see if you are communicating with the train controller successfully.

# Lecture 3: Odds and Ends

## Polling Loops

Polling loops allow you to manage more than one condition/activity pair at the same time.

The basic polling loop

```c
FOREVER {
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c2 ) a2;
    ...
    if( cN ) aN;
}
```
    
Note, for example, that if `c1` tests the receive port of a UART, receiving a command from the terminal, then something like the following sequence must occur.
1. `a1` must collect the command, probably terminated by ENTER into a buffer,
2. and set a condition, such as `c2`, that indicates there is a command to be processed.
3. Then `a2` must the parse the command and write a buffer containing the string to be sent to the train controller,
4. and set a condition, `c3`, indicating that there are bytes to be sent to the train controller.
5. Then another condition, `c4`, indicating that the transmit port of the train controller UART is empty, must be ANDed with  `c3` to trigger the action `a4` that puts the next byte into the transmit port.

Note that transmitting is different from receiving: only one thing must be true in order to receive (a byte present in the receiver), but two things must be true in order to transmit (a the transmit port ready and a byte that needs to be transmitted).

Please remember that there may be other conditions that are also trying to send things to the train controller, so that the buffer containing strings to be sent to the train controller must not interleave the messages.

What can you do if think your polling loop is too slow?

* Time the loop to make sure that you are right. Afterwards, keep this code, giving debugging output only if it's too slow.
* Figure out which action must run the most often, and what the longest repeat time it can tolerate. If this exceeds your loop time then you know where the problem is.
* Estimate the time of different actions and figure out where is the mid-point of your loop's execution.
* Insert an extra test and action for the failing action at the mid-point.
* Repeat as needed.

Like this:
```c
FOREVER {
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( c2 ) a2;
    ...
    if( cn ) an;
    if( c1 ) a1;
    if( cn+1 ) an+1;
    ...
    if( cN ) aN;
}
```

## A few odds and ends about UARTs
  
**Error conditions in UARTs**

There is a receive status register in each UART that tells you something about receive errors. Two bits that can help you are:

* 0: FE, framing error. This occurs when the stop bit does not occur when expected, which usually means that you have mismatched speeds.
* 3: OE, overrun error. This means that a second byte was received before the first one was read, which usually means that your receive software is too slow.

**The data register**

## A few odds and ends about trains

At most 8 of the bits in the integer you read have genuine content. Masking is usual.

**Talking to the train controller**

This is the hardest part of Ass. 0. If nothing happens to the train the problem can be

* a bug in your code
* a misunderstanding of UART documentation
* an error in UART documentation
* the train controller not receiving
* your software sending the wrong bytes
* a misunderstanding of the Marklin documentation
* an error in the Marklin documentation
* something else

Putting a terminal into the connector that usually connects the ARM box to the train controller will help you to eliminate possible sources or error more easily. In fact, old dumb terminals had an extra connector on the back and passed everything coming in on one connector out the other while displaying it on the screen, just to make debugging communications easier.

Today you can achieve the same thing using the two COM parts of a simple PC.

* Unplug the cable connecting the COM1 port on the ARM box.
* Connect a COM port on the PC to the COM1 port of the ARM box.
* Connect the other COM port on the PC to the train controller.
* Either use terminal emulators to pass bytes from one COM port to the other, and vice versa, or write a tiny C program to do the same thing, displaying the bytes as you pass them through.

This is an important problem solving technique that you use all the time, possibly without noticing it: break a complex problem into two or more simple ones.
Turning a train headlight on and off is an easy way to see if you are communicating with the train controller successfully.

**States of Three-way Switches**

The three way switches are actually a pair of switches so they have four states
States of three-way switches
| Switch 1  | Switch 2  | Result        |
| ----------|:---------:| -------------:|
| Straight	| Straight	| Straight      |
| Straight  | Curved	| Curve Right   |
| Curved	| Straight	| Curve Left    |
| Curved	| Curved	| Probable Derailment |

## UART Flow Control

All hardware & software has buffers somewhere

* Buffers always overflow, sooner or later
* When buffers overflow something bad happens
    * Lose data either off the end, or off the start, depends on implementation
    * You can control it with software (^S & ^Q)
        * Often loses part of the transmission because of unpredictable time lags
    * You can control it with hardware, which is what the train controller does.

**Three-wire RS-232**

We need what's called a null modem. Without the crossover it's called straight through.

| | connects to
| ----------|:---------:| 
signal ground |	signal ground
transmit (XMIT)	|receive (RCV)
receive (RCV)|	transmit (XMIT)

**Five-wire RS-232**

Two extra wires are added to provide flow control

* Clear to Send (CTS) asserted when a receiver is ready to receive input, negated when the receiver is not ready to receive input.
    * Written by the receiver; read by the transmitter. If you are a hardware person you would say "Driven by the receiver; latched by the transmitter."
* Request to Send (RTS), asserted when the transmitter has bytes ready to transmit, negated when the transmitter has nothing to transmit
    * Written by the transmitter, read by the receiver.

| |connects to
----------|:---------:
signal ground	| signal ground
transmit (XMIT)	| receive (RCV)
receive (RCV)	| transmit (XMIT)
clear to send (CTS)	| request to send (RTS)
request to send (RTS) |	clear to send (CTS)

The train controller asserts RTS, which is read as CTS by the UART. The train controller ignores the RS-232 input if you send when CTS is not asserted. Of course, nothing is sent to you saying that a byte has been lost. Note. You can lose bytes if you turn on the high speed CPU clock and/or the caches. You were already told to leave both those system settings as they are.


# Lecture 4: Tasks & Kernels

**A few interesting things about RedBoot**

The program you wrote for a0 puts its local variables on a stack. 

This enables you to get a clean return to RedBoot when your program terminates.  

When your program crashes it's because an exception has been generated because of, for example,
* an illegal instruction
* an unhandled interrupt
* an invalid memory reference (seg fault)

Redboot catches the exception, and puts out some information onto which gcc might hook. (ecos and RedHat are strongly connected to the GNU project. (Don't bother trying to use gdb!) You see the information on the bottom two lines of the terminal window. It's useless except for one 8 digit number starting 00218 or 00219. This is the address of the last instruction the CPU attempted to execute. Using the load map and the assembly code you can find exactly how far the program got before crashing. Unfortunately, the error may have occurred long before execution stopped. The amount a program runs after the error occurred increases as the term goes on.


## Kernel Introduction

The base unit of a polling loop is
```c
if ( condition ) action;
``` 

We generalize this structure only a little in constructing the kernel of our operating system: the kernel determines when the condition is true, then readies the task that executes the action, which terminates by informing the kernel of the condition for its next execution. 

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the kernel may -- **but is NOT guaranteed to** -- run a task immediately after it is made ready. The kernel's task handling code must be correct whether the task is run immediately or only after other tasks have run. The bugs created when this is wrong are neither easy to find by testing nor easy to repair. They should be designed out. 

In the next few weeks we will build, from scratch, a micro-kernel. The micro-kernel supervises the execution of tasks, which are the elements of our systems. A task consists of
1. a set of instructions that it executes,
2. memory in which it stores data, and
3. state, such as processor state, kernel state, and so on.

The kernel provides support for a running task (the active task), allowing it to
1. create a new task,
2. send a message to another task,
3. receive a message from another task, and
4. wait for an interrupt to occur.

These basic needs are provided by the kernel of every operating system. The kernel we create in cs452 is a microkernel, because it provides these capabilities and nothing more.

We build the microkernel in four assignments
1. task creation and scheduling
2. inter-task communication
3. the interrupt primitive
4. complex servers

The real-time operating system we build consists of
1. an uninterruptible microkernel, plus
2. interruptible device-handling server tasks that run in user-space.

## What Does a Microkernel Provide?

**Tasks**

A program is conceived as a collection of co-operating tasks. Tasks provide applications with modularity. Task structure as a method of program organization will be discussed about the time you are finishing the OS.

Why are tasks important?
* Thinking about one thing at a time is easy.
    * Listen to me lecturing to you.
* Thinking about more than one thing at a time is hard.
    * Keep on listening, and at the same time think about what frustrated you most during a0.
* Trying to solve more than one real-time problem at a time by thinking, is very hard
    * think about turning the wheel, peddling and balancing while learning to ride a bicycle
    * How did you learn to coordinate all these activities in real-time?
* Tasks allow a programmer to reduce parts of a activity into sequences of instructions that communicate with other sequences.

The programmer can then separate reasoning about his or her program into reasoning about single-threaded task execution and inter-task communication 

**Communication**

Communication has two aspects
1. sharing data and
2. synchronization.

We use Send/Receive/Reply (SRR) to do both.
1. Send blocks
2. Receive blocks: synchronizes with the call to send
3. Reply doesn't block: synchronizes its return with the return from send.

**Interrupts**

In the polling loop you polled a register
* to discover if input had arrived
* to discover if you could send output

Almost every test failed, which wasted CPU. Even worse, it increases the response time, the time from when the event occurs until the first instruction of user code responding to it occurs. (Exercise for the reader. For each condition/action pair in a0, what proportion of the condition tests evaluated to false?)

You can get rid of the polling tests if you program the hardware to send the CPU a signal when the condition for which you are waiting occurs. Such a signal is called an exception and the CPU goes into a privileged state when the interrupt occurs.

The kernel responds to the exception by reading volatile data and readying the task that is waiting on the interrupt. This task is essentially the action that was conditioned on the event in the polling loop.

## Tasks

The first part of the kernel requires you to create, schedule and run a collection of tasks. What is a task?

1. A set of instructions
2. The current state, which is changed by executing instructions. The state of a task includes
    * values of its local variables, which are automatic variables maintained on the stack
    * contents of its registers
    * other processor state such as the PSR
        * processor mode
        * condition codes
        * etc.
    * its run state and other things maintained by the kernel. These things are normally packed together in a task descriptor (TD), of which there is one per task.  

    When a task enters the kernel its state must be saved completely, so that when it begins executing again, the kernel can restore its state exactly. The analogy to how a function is called and returned from is important to understand.

Two tasks can use the same set of instructions, but every task has its own local state, which is maintained on its private stack. (To provide each task with a private stack the kernel must split up memory among tasks.) There is some memory that is shared among tasks with the same set of instructions.
* constants located with the instructions, such as format strings for printf and its relatives, and
* variables of the static storage class, which are placed wherever your linker script tells them to go.

Static variables may be useful but they are dangerous. Good programming practice says that they should be written once and after that only read.

The kernel keeps track of every task's state

* In essence, servicing a request amounts to changing the state of one or more tasks.
* Kernel maintains a task descriptor (TD) for each created task.
* That is, to create a task the kernel must allocate a TD and initialize it.

Possible states of the task

1. Active: If the system is in user space, the active task is in the CPU, running. If the system is in the kernel the active task has either just finished running or is about to run. You are in control of when it changes from one to the other.
    * On a single processor system only one task can ever be active.
    * But we would like to build our kernel so that it can scale to more than one processor.
2. Ready: Will be made act
    * Need a queue used by the scheduler when deciding which task should be the next active task
3. Blocked: waiting for something to happen
    * Need several queues, one for each thing that could happen

The single blocked, zombie, state will differentiate into several different blocked states as the kernel develops.

## Kernel Structure

The kernel is just a function (with no arguments and no return value like a task), and which runs forever. It runs forever because like most real programs it terminates when the user decides it should terminate.

```c
void main( ) {
    initialize( );  // includes starting the first user task
FOREVER {
    active = schedule( );
    request = activate( active );
    handle( request );
    }
}
```
    
or, if you prefer, here is a three line kernel,
```c
void main( ) {
    initialize( );  // includes creating the first user task
    FOREVER handle( activate( schedule( ) );
}
```

There are a few data structures to declare and a few functions to implement, but you get the idea.

Let's unpack this a little.

1. `initialize( )`. The kernel first prepares the CPU, the memory and the devices to run the program.
2. `FOREVER.` (AKA `while( true )` or `for( ; true; )`). A real-time program usually controls a system. It shuts itself down only if something goes seriously wrong. Otherwise something in the controlled system decides when it's time that the system is no longer needed.
3. `schedule( )`. The kernel chooses the next task to run, which is the highest priority task among those that are ready to run. This task becomes the active task.
4. `activate( active )`. The kernel installs the active task on the CPU and sets it running. When the active task can run no more activate( ) returns a request for service from the user program.
5. `handle( request )`. The kernel handles the request, then schedules again.
Writing a kernel is just a matter of implementing these functions.

In the first part of the kernel we implement creating tasks, scheduling them and running them. Central to this is implementing a kernel service requested by calling the function `Create( )` in a user task.


# Lecture 5

## Building a Microkernel: Context Switches

The kernel is just a function like any other, except that it
* runs forever,
* takes no arguments, and
* has no return value.
```c
main( ) {
    initialize( );  // includes starting the first user task
    FOREVER {
        handle( activate( schedule( ) ) );
    }
}
```  

* `schedule( )` returns the highest priority task on the ready queues, the next active task;
* `activate( active )` returns the request produced by installing and running the active task;
* `handle` provides the service requested by the most recent active task, most of which is manipulating the kernel's internal data structures.

What's inside activate( active )?
1. Transfer of control to the active task
2. Execution to completion of the active task
    * "to completion" means either
        * until it makes a request to the kernel, or
        * until a hardware interrupt occurs, which doesn't happen until the third part of the kernel.
3. Transfer of control back to the kernel

The hard part to get right is "transfer of control"

* We call the code that transfers control a "context switch"
* Programming a context switch requires you to know the processor architecture.

## ARM 920T core
### Documentation overview

Inside the grey box we have
* an ARM T920 processor core inside
* a Cirrus EP9302 system on chip (SoC), mounted on
* a TS7200 circuit board.

Each of these has its own documentation. For the context switch we are interested in the ARM architecture manual. We have v4 of the ARM architecture.

The ARM architecture manual covers
* the ARM v4T instruction set
    * 32 bit word, 32 bit address/data bus
    * all instructions one word
        * except thumb instructions (T suffix), which you don't use
    * in-order instruction issue, which means no speculative execution,
    * some instructions privileged, which means not executable in user mode.
* Only one instruction that lets you from the unprivileged mode (user) into a privileged mode: SWI -- software interrupt
    * not quite true
    * illegal instruction
    * prefetch abort
    * data abort

    And many operating systems do, in fact, use one or another of these, just because they are available.
* Core includes
    * CPU
    * MMU
    * L1 cache
    * Co-processor interface: for system control and for floating point
    * System control co-processor

Features

1. Program status register, which you will find in two places: the current program status register (CPSR) and the saved program status register (SPSR). The PSR has three parts
    1. four bits of condition codes / flags. Every instruction has four bits that correspond to the four condition codes, and is executed only if these bits match the bits in the instruction. The bit pattern b1110 indicates unconditional execution.
    2. three bits of interrupt/instruction state
    3. five bits of processor mode

    Bit	| Mnemonic	| Meaning
    --- | --- | ---
    31	| N	 | Negative
    30	| Z	| Zero
    29	| C	| Carry
    28	| V	| Overflow
    8-27 |	DNM |	Does not matter in v4
    7	| I	| Interrupts disabled
    6	| F |	Fast interrupts disabled. Set, but do not change.
    5	| T	| Thumb execution. Set but do not change.
    4	| M4 |	Five processor mode bits
    3	| M3|	
    2	|M2 |
    1	|M1	|
    0	|M0	|

    Notice that the SPSR is mode specific. Failing to take into account the mode-specificity of SPSR has over the years been the cause of very subtle (= hard to find) bugs in the kernel.

2. There are seven processor modes, of which the first part of the kernel uses only three: user, supervisor, and system. We use a fourth, irq, when we implement hardware interrupts.

    M[4:0]	| Mode	| Registers accessible |	Used for
    ---|---|---|---
    10000	|User	| `r0-r15` <br/> <br/> `cspr` | OS servers, application code
    10010 |	IRQ (Interrupt processing)	| `r0-r12`, `r15` <br/> `r13_irq` <br/> `r14_irq` <br/> <br/> `cpsr`, `spsr_irq` |Responding to an ordinary interrupt
    10011 |	Supervisor | `r0-r12`, `r15` <br/> `r13_svc`, `r14_svc` <br/><br/> `cpsr`, `sprs_svc` | Kernel runs in this mode
    11111 |	System | `r0-r15` <br/> <br/> `cpsr` | Execute privileged instructions while seeing all user mode registers.

3. 16 32-bit registers
    * r15, pc, special in the architecture
    * r14, lr, special in the architecture
    * r13, sp, special in the architecture
    * r12, ip, used by gcc as a scratch register
    * r11, fp, used by gcc as the frame pointer
    * r10, sl
    * r4 to r9, used by gcc to store data over function calls, if used, must be saved by the called function.
    * r0 to r3, used by gcc as scratch registers and function arguments.
    * r0, used by gcc for the value returned by a function.

    This set of registers are the ones a programmer, or compiler, sees in User mode. There are partially separate register sets in some other modes, which are essential for writing a kernel.

4. Exceptions, which divert the processor from its normal flow of instructions. We are concerned only with two exceptions, reset and software interrupt, in the first part of the kernel. The ordinary interrupt will be used when we implement hardware interrupts. Some students use others, but most don't.

    | Exception Type | Modes Called from | Mode at Completion |  Instruction Address |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    Reset |hardware | supervisor |	`0x00`
    Software interrupt| 	any	|supervisor| `0x08`
    Ordinary interrupt|	any	|IRQ|	`0x18`

    1. You are concerned right now with Reset and Software Interrupt.
        * Undefined instruction, Prefetch abort & Data abort may occur on execution errors. They are the equivalent of `seg fault`.
    2. The first instruction executed by the CPU after reset is the one at location `0x00000000`. Usually it is 
        ```
        ldr  pc, [pc, #0x18] ; 0xe590f018 is the binary encoding
        ```
        which you will normally find in addresses `0x00` to `0x1c`. Just executing an instruction, rather than having an address that is specially processed saves transistors, which is good. You see `#0x18` where you might expect to see `#0x20#` because the evaluation of the offset from pc occurs in the third stage of the pipeline so that the pc has been incremented twice.

    3. This instruction moves into the program counter whatever address it finds in the locations 0x20 to 0x3c. RedBoot puts entry points of RedBoot into all these addresses.
    4. This makes it possible to jump to any location in the 32 bit address space.
    5. Note endianness of RedBoot output when examining these locations.
5. Three data types
    * word: 32 bits, word-aligned
    * half-word: 16 bits, half-word-aligned
    * byte: 8 bits

**General Comments**
1. each instruction is exactly one word
2. load and store RISC architecture
3. rich set of addressing modes, based on barrel shifting
4. allows you to keep any partial computation it makes

## Context Switch
## What gcc does

How gcc uses the registers
* r0-r3
    * scratch registers
    * arguments to function calls
    * return value (r0)
    
    saved into local variables before function call
* r4-r10: scratch registers, saved on stack in function preamble, then restored
* r11: frame pointer, saved in function preamble, then restored
* r12: special scratch register
* r13-r15: stack pointer, link register, program counter

Function call
1. Save r0-r3 into local variables.
2. Put arguments into r0-r3.
3. `bl #entry; lr gets pc, pc gets #entry`
4. `mov ip, sp; allows multiple store`
5. push {fp, ip, lr} onto stack; possibly other registers
6. application code gets arguments from the register, does its thing, then puts the return value into r0.
7. pop {fp, sp, pc} from stack; possibly others. This returns from the function.
8. put r0 (return value) into local variable

### Step-by-step

**Function Call (gcc calling conventions)**
```assembly
; In calling code
                      ; store values of r0-r3
                      ; load arguments into r0-r3
   bl  #entry - pc   ; this treats the pc and lr specially: lr <- pc, pc <- <entry>
                      ; On return: r0 has the return value, r1-r3 have useless junk

; In called code
entry:
   mov     ip, sp
   stmdb   sp!, {fp, ip, lr} ; and sometimes others, 
                             ; determined by the registers the function uses
   ...
   ldmia   sp, {fp, sp, pc} ; and whatever others
                            ; exact inverse of stmdb
```

This sequence of four instructions is an example of the NOP design pattern, named by Bobby Xiao.

Note the role of the index pointer (ip), link register (lr) and stack pointer (sp). 

The final instruction could be
```assembly
   ldmia   sp, {fp, sp, lr}
   mov     pc, lr
```
The sequence
```assembly
   bl   <junk> - pc
   .
   .
   .
junk:
   mov   pc, lr
```
which is also a NOP. We build big NOPs, like the function call and return (and the contgext switch) by expanding small NOPs like this one.

**Software Interrupt `SWI`**

The software interrupt instruction ( `SWI{cond} <immed_24>` ). What happens when it is executed?

1. `lr_svc` gets address of the following instruction. This is where the kernel will return to.
2. `SPSR_svc` gets `CPSR`. This saves the mode, condition codes, etc.
3. `CPSR[0:4]` gets `0b10011`. Supervisor mode.
4. `CPSR[5]` gets 0. ARM (not Thumb) state.
5. `CPSR[6]` gets 1. Privileged interrupts disabled.
6. `CPSR[7]` gets 1. Normal interrupts disabled.
7. PC gets `0x08`

The CPU ignores the 24-bit immediate value, which can be used by the programmer as another argument, usually identifying the system call.
```assembly
; In calling code
                          ; Store r0-r3 ; Put arguments into r0-r3
                          ; 0x28 holds the kernel entry point
   swi  n                 ; n identifies the system call
                          ; retrieve return value from r0 ; r1-r3 have useless junk

; In kernel
kernel entry:
			   ; Change to system mode
			   ; Save user state on user stack
			   ; Return to supervisor mode
   ldr    r4, [lr, #-4]    ; gets the request type
                           ; at this point you can get the arguments
                           ; Where are they?
			   ; Retrieve kernel state from kernel stack
			   ; Do kernel work
```
The sequence
```assembly
   swi   n
   .
   .
   .
kernel entry:
   movs   pc, lr
```
   
is a `NOP`. The 's' in movs puts the SPSW into pc.

Questions:

1. What is above kernel entry?
2. If you put swi in a wrapper or stub what happens before and after it?
3. If the request had arguments, how would you get them into the kernel? 
    Hint. How does gcc pass arguments into a function?
4. It might be important that there are three link registers. Which three link registers? Why?
5. In practice it isn't important. Why not? It will be very important later.

Suggestions:
1. Try this first on paper drawing the stack, registers, etc after each instruction
2. Try coding in baby steps, which is usually a good idea in assembly language.


# Lecture 6 - Notes

```C
...
tid = Create( priorityQ, code );
...
```

Create (int, *(fn()))

Function pointer points to address of first instruction

Step 5: push {fp, ip, lr} onto stack using `strm`
Step 7: execute a service request to the kernel and gets back the tid of the created task using `swi`
Step 9: pop {fp, sp, pc} from stack using `ldrm`


mode in PSR is SVC
mode in SPSR is user mode

When switching to kernel: 
* Switch to system mode (with visibility of user sp) to save r0 - r15 on user stack
    * switch by writing over its "mode" psr

All kernel knows about task is its TD. 

Task Descriptor: 
* stores sp of the task
* it's a data structure in the kernel
* make it as small as possible (to keep in cache later)

Activate (): 

Before kernel entry: 
* save kernel state
* install user state


Entering Kernel: 
* store user state
* restore kernel state
* start handling the request
