## 1.1 What is the internet? 

### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

Host / end systems: connected together by communication links and packet switches

Communication links: made up of different physical media; eg. coaxical cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. 
* Transfer data at different transmission rate

When sending data, the sending end system segments the data into packets and adds header bytes to each packet. The packets are reassembled into original data by the destination end system. 

Packet switch: takes a packet arriving on an incoming communication links and forward the packet on an outgoing communication link. 
* Routers: used in network core
* Link-layer switches: used in access networks

Route / path: sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from sending to receiving end system

ISP (Internet Service Providers): a network of packet switches and communication links
* Provide network access to end systems: eg. cable modem, DSL, high-speed local area network access, wireless access, dia-up modem access
* Provide Internet access to content providers
* Low-tier ISPs interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISP
* Upper-tier ISP consists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links
* Each ISP netowrk is managed independently, runs IP protocol and conforms to naming and address conventions

Protocols: End systems, packet switches, and other pieces run protocols to control sending and receiving of information within the Internet. Principal protocols known as TCP/IP. 
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
* Internet Protocol (IP): specifies format of packets

Internet standards
* RFCs (Request for comments), set out by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP, SMTP
* IEEE 802 specifies Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards

### 1.1.2 A Services Description

Internet is an infrastructure that provides services to **distributed applications** - applications that involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. 
* emails, web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, VoIP, video streaming, etc.

Internet applications run on end systems and instruct Internet to deliver data to other end systems through an **Application Programming Interface (API)** - a set of rules that sending program must follow. 

 ### 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol

Protocols define format and order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as actions taken on transmission or receipt of a message or otherevent

* Hardware-implemented protocols between two physically connected computers control flow of bits on the wire between two network interface cards. 
* Congestion-control protocols control rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver
* Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

Requesting a URL from web browser: 
* Computer sends a connection request message to the Web server and wait for reply
* Web server receives request message, return a connection reply message
* Computer receives reply message, sends the name of the Web page it wants to fetch from that Web server in a GET message
* Web server returns the Web page (file) to computer


## 1.2 The Network Edge

Hosts sometime divided into clients and servers. Servers often reside in large data centers. 

### 1.2.1 Access Networks

Access network: physically connects an end system to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system

**Home access**
Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are: 
* Digital subscriber line (DSL)
* cable

A residence typically obtains DSL internet from same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access
* DSL modem uses existing telephone line (twisted-pair copper wire) to exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in telco's local central office (CO)
* modem takes digital data, translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to CO
* analog signals translated back into digital format at DSLAM

Telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, encoded at different frequencies: 
* high-speed downstream channel
* medium-speed upstream channel
* ordinary two-way telephone channel

A single DSL link appears as if there were three seperate links, so telephone call and Internet connection share DSL link at the same time.
