# CS 458 A1

Written response: 

1. 
    (a) This is a violation of confidentiality, because Oxford Analytica is not authorized to access the full Facebook profiles of the users that haven't granted the permission, based on Facebook's privacy settings. However, the confidentiality problem of Facebook's API granted them this access. 

    This is also a violation of privacy, since the Facebook users should have control of who gets to access the data, but in reality they don't. 

    (b) This is a violation of availability. OA can no longer access data from authorized users either. 

    (c) This is a violation of integrity. The model received by OA's client is not accurate due to the made-up data. 

    (d) This is also a violation of integrity. The lack of usage metadata prevents the verification of data integrity. 

2. 
    (a) Modification: the program is altered by the additional commits to potentially perform malicious/insecure tasks. 

    (b) Interception: The changes to the authentication protocol (the modification of the program) gives the company unauthorized access to secret client files - the ability to intercept client data. 

    (c) Interception: The data is being intercepted through the hop and the company has gained unauthorized access to the employee's data. 

    (d) Interruption: The employee has lost access to sensitive company files - his access has been tampered with / revoked / destroyed

3. 
    (a) Deflecting. 
        Place some incriminating documents on the desk of a co-worker witha history of misbehaviour. 

    (b) Preventing: Document your actions in the company with timestamped journals and keep written documentation of all commits and emails to prevent Oxford Analytica of falsely accusing you.  

    (c) Detecting: Ask trusted friend in the company to keep an eye out for you and warn you if Oxford Analytica does anything suspicious. 

    (d) Recovering: Hire a lawyer and go to court against Oxford Analytica. 


Sploit 1

The buffer overflow vulnerability is used in sploit1. There is a vulnerability in the copy_file() function. The character array 'buf' has a fixed length of 3072, but the while loop will copy over the entire content of src_file, leading to a buffer overflow if the source file contains more than 3072 characters. 

```
p1 = buf;
while ((c = fgetc(src_file)) != EOF) {
    *p1 = c;
    p1++;
}
```

Gdb was used to find the exact address of the buffer I intend to overflow, "0xffbfd1e8". 

My sploit program creates a larger buffer of 3100 characters. The large buffer contains the following pieces of information in order: 
1. NOPs: A series of NOPs fill up the beginning of the large buffer. This ensures that when the code is executed, the program will do nothing until the shellcode. 
2. The shellcode: To avoid signature detection by check_for_virus(), the shellcode is placed such that the "/sh" part of "bin/sh" starts at index 1024. The scanner, which takes every 1024 characters and scan for "bin/sh", will never find the full signature. 
3. Random values: The end of the shellcode to index 3071. This fills up the remaining of the original buffer. I used the NULL (\0x0) character in the code, but any ASCII character should suffice. 
4. "0xffbfd1e8": This is the address of the buffer I intend to overflow. The rest of the large buffer is filled with this value the RET value of copy_file() will be overwritten with this value. 

When returning from the copy_file(), the PC will jump to 0xffbfd1e8, execute a bunch of NOPs, then execute the shellcode, granting us a shell with root access. 

The vulnerability can be fixed by: 

1. Keeping track of current index, and bound checking when writing into the char array. 
2. Limit the length of source file to 3072 characters, or implement an algorithm to copy longer content without overflowing the buffer. 
3. Scanning for the virus signature in a more rigorous manner.
