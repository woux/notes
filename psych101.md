# Lecture 7: Motivation & Emotion

## Motivation

**Motivation**
* set of physiological and psychologcial processes that initiate goal-directed behaviours
  * hunger & thirst
  * sex
  * safety
  * social belonging & achievement
* homeostasis: maintenance of consistent internal states in response to outer environment
  * fluid balance, acidity of extracellular fluid, chemical gradients, blood sugar, body temperature
* drive: biological trigger (thirst) that tell us to seek an incentive (water)
* stress: psychological & physiological reaction that occurs when perceived demands exceed existing resources to meet demand
  * consumes a lot of energy
  * motivation influenced by current needs and anticipation of future needs caused by stress
* allostasis: process of achieving homeostasis through psychological and behavioural changes
  * eat more when stressed

**Hunger**
* controlled by pshysiological processes that encourage homeostasis
* cognitive and emotional factors
  * stress
  * fatigue
  * social cues
  - advertising and social norms
  - portion sizes

Brain: 
* hypothalamus: controls hunger
  * stimulate lateral hypothalmus: rat eats
  * stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus: rat stops eating
* hypothalamus monitors blood chemistry for sugar/hormone level
  - glucostats signal hypothalamus to increase hunger when glucose is low

Psychology: 
* awareness of food impacts hunger
* calorie-densed food stimulate release of dopamine in nucleus accumbens
* unit-bias: assume unit of portioning is right amount to consume
* trigger food: food that affect healthy/unhealthy food choices through presence

Social Psychology: 
* social facilitation: social situations encourage people to eat more
* impression management: control behavior to impress
* modelling: model behavior after others

Disordered Eating: 
* anorexia: self-starvation, fear of gaining weight, denial of consequences of low weight
  * do not seek treatment
  * low impulsivity
* Bulimia: periods of food deprivation, binge-eating, and purging (vomiting, fasting, laxatives, exercise)
  * more likely to seek treatment
  * tendency for impulsivity
* binge eating disorder: frequent episodes of binge-eating without purging; lack of control
* avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: aversion to food based on smell, taste, texture, brand
  * cause disturbance to satiety, weight, nutrition
* rumination syndrome: repeated regurgitation of food
  * regurgitated food re-swallowed or spit out
  * regurgitation not due to medical condition
* pica: appetite for non-nutritive substances
* other specified feeding or eating disorder; eg. purging disorder; night eating syndrome

**Sex**

* Sexual arousal: rated using self-report scales or physiological measures (heart rate, blood pressure, penile / vaginal plethysmograph)
* Sexual response cycle

Brain/hormone: 
* sexual stimulation -> activity in hypothalamus -> stimulates pituitary gland to release oxytocin
* oxytocin surges after orgasm, stays elevated for at least 5 minutes
* associate with feelings of trust - promote bonding

Gender difference
* refactory period: in men, usually not in women
* orgasm gap: men experience more frequent orgasms
* gender roles
* sexual scripts
* sex guilt: negative emotions related to violating sexual scripts or norms

Cybersex
* deindividuation: make poor choices when they feel anonymous

Sex and advertising
* sexual imagery can enhance memory for product

Orientations: 
* Sexual orientation
* Romantic orientation
* both defined by desire and personal identification, not behaviour

Common sexual orientations:
* heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, demisexual, unsure/questioning, fluid, queer, androphilic, gynephilic

Sexual minorities
- freud suggests (w/o evidence) male homosexuality results from domineering mothers / weak father figures
- may be natural
- appears to be heritable - rougly 50% of variability due to genetics (at least in men)

Gender minorities
- transgender: experiences mismatch in assigned and identified gender
- transsexual: wishes to permanently transition
- transvestite / crossdresser: enjoys wearing clothes typically worn by other gender
- drag queen: crossdressers for public performance

**Social & Achievement Goals**

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (pyramid model)
- self actualization needs: find self-fulfillment and realize one's potential
- aesthetic needs: symmetry, order, beauty
- cognitive needs: to know, understand, explore
- esteem needs: to achieve, be competent, gain approval / recognition
- belonging and love needs: to be with others, be accepted, belong
- safety needs
- physiological needs: hunger, thirst, fatigue

Social Needs
* need to belong
* prefer permanent relationships
* close long-term relationships linked with
  - ratings of happiness/life satisfaction
  - mental health
  - physical health

Love
* companionate love: involves intimacy & affection we feel for another person when we care deeply
* passionate love: intense longing for another person, accompanied by physiological arousal

Evolutionary: 
* pair-bonding promotes reproductive behaviors
* group more likely to survive
* pair-bonding derive from parent-child bonding

Terror management thoery: 
* fear of mortality promotes behaviors that reassures us (anxiety buffers)
* cultural worldview, sense of belonging, self-esteem

Achievement Needs
* drive to perform at high levels 
  * approach goal: drawn towards pleasant incentive -> happiness
  * avoidance goal: avoid unpleasant outcome -> relief

Self determination theory
* humans have needs for
  * relatedness
  * autonomy
  * competence: being able to perform task
    * self-efficacy: confidence in own ability to complete task
* individual's ability to attain wellbeing influenced by their degree of control over behaviours necessary to reach their goals
  * idea: human have inherent tendency towards growth and development, but needs to be nurtured to do so
* intrinsic motivation: desire to engage in activity because enjoyment / fullfills personal goal
* extrinsic motivation: desire to engage in activity b/c external rewards or pressures
* to preserve intrinsic motivation: 
  * avoid overjustification effect - don't reward for things they already enjoy
  * task-contigent vs. performance-contigent rewards
    * performance-contigent rewards increase interest because it conveys competence

## Emotion

Emotions are behaviours with 3 components: 
- psychological: subjectve thought/experience
- physiological: accompany patterns of neural activity and physiological arousal
- behavioural: observable behavioural expression (facial expression, muscle tension, heart rate, etc.)

When sensing emotional stimulus: 
1. Initial response within 150ms of sensing:
    * amygdala receives initial info, sends feedback to sensory areas to fir emore
    * highlights this stimulus as something to pay attention to
2. autonomic response
    * autonomic nervous system respond with sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system
3. emotional reponse (movement)
    * get ready to respond physically
    * emotional stimuli trigger increase in motor cortex activity
4. evaluation and emotion regulation
    * frontal lobe receive info from amygdala and sensory areas, decide whether emotional response is actually needed
    * generate behaviour appropriate for the situation

Theories of emotion: 
1. Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion: emotional experiences precede physiological and behavioural components
    * brain interprets situation, generates subjective feelings, feelings trigger responses in body
2. James-Lange Theory of Emotion: physiological/behavioural components precede emotional experiences
    * physiological responses come first, perceived as emotion, followed by reaction
3. Schachter & Singer: 2 factor theory of emotion
    * "physiological arrousal" occurs, use immediate environment to search for emotional cues for "conigitive labels"
    * multiple emotions can have similar physiologcical patterns
    * result in misattribution of arousal

Facial Expressions
- Cultural variations in facial expressions
- display rules: expectations about when it's appropriate to show certain emotions
- smiles: Duchenne vs non-Duchenne smiles
- affect blends: one part of face registers one emotion, another part registers a different emotion
- expressions are adaptive
  - digust: reduces airflow
  - surprise: inhale deeply, widening eye prepares us to deal with threat

Body language
- open to sexual encounter: eyebrow flash, attempt to make eye contact
- confidence, control: back straight, shoulders back
- anxiety, boredom: fidgeting

Paralanguage: nonlexical components of speech (pitch, speed, volume)


# Lecture 8: Disorder and Therapy

## Disorders

**Defining and classifying disorders**

Medical model: seeing psychological conditions as set of symptoms, causes and outcomes; treatment aimed at changing physiological processes to alleviate symptoms

Biopsychosocial model: includes physiological processes as one factor in holistic view of person; involves multiple interacting systems

Behaviors vary with culture, age, gender, etc. 

Abnormal: maldaptive behaviours, thoughts, feelings-
* causing distress to you or others
* impairing day-to-day functioning
- increasing risk of injury or harm to yourself or others

DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)
* 3 sections for each disorder
  * set of symptoms, threshold for symptoms that must be met to diagnose
  * etiology (origins/causes) of symptoms
  * prognosis for how symptoms will persist or change over time
* Critisisms: 
  * categorization (vs continuum)
  * subjectivity in interpolation
  * past versions have included conditions such as homosexuality
  * substantial overlap in symptoms => common misdiagnosis
    * eg. anhedonia is symptom of depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse, PTSD, and antisocial personality disorder
  * act of labelling someone can change their outcome significantly

How to diagnose mental illness? 
* DSM
* Genetic markers
* brain scans
* indicators of neurotransmitter dysfunction

**Personality disorders**

Personality disorders are behaviours that are maladaptive, distressing to oneself/others, resistant to change. 

Cluster A: odd/eccentric
1. Paranoid personality disorder: paranoia, difficult trusting others
2. Schizoid personality disorder: preference for isolation, difficult forming relationships
3. Schizotypal personality disorder: odd way of thinking/expression; difficult forming relationships

Cluster B: emotional/erratic
1. Bordelrine personality disorder
    * impulsive, unstable, manipulative
    * extremes between positive and negative emotions
    * unstable sense of self, insecure
    * believe to arise from severe emotional disturbances
2. Narcissistic personality disorder: 
    * inflated sense of self importance
    * excessive need for admiration
    * sensitive to critisism and rejection
    * insecure, self-doubt, fear of abandonment
    * little empathy for others
3. Histrionic personality disorder: attention-seaking, flamboyant, dramatic
4. Antisocial personality disorder, lack empathy, abusive, impulsive
