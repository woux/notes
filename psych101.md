# Lecture 7: Motivation & Emotion

## Motivation

**Motivation**
* set of physiological and psychologcial processes that initiate goal-directed behaviours
  * hunger & thirst
  * sex
  * safety
  * social belonging & achievement
* homeostasis: maintenance of consistent internal states in response to outer environment
  * fluid balance, acidity of extracellular fluid, chemical gradients, blood sugar, body temperature
* drive: biological trigger (thirst) that tell us to seek an incentive (water)
* stress: psychological & physiological reaction that occurs when perceived demands exceed existing resources to meet demand
  * consumes a lot of energy
  * motivation influenced by current needs and anticipation of future needs caused by stress
* allostasis: process of achieving homeostasis through psychological and behavioural changes
  * eat more when stressed

**Hunger**
* controlled by pshysiological processes that encourage homeostasis
* cognitive and emotional factors
  * stress
  * fatigue
  * social cues
  - advertising and social norms
  - portion sizes

Brain: 
* hypothalamus: controls hunger
  * stimulate lateral hypothalmus: rat eats
  * stimulate ventromedial hypothalamus: rat stops eating
* hypothalamus monitors blood chemistry for sugar/hormone level
  - glucostats signal hypothalamus to increase hunger when glucose is low

Psychology: 
* awareness of food impacts hunger
* calorie-densed food stimulate release of dopamine in nucleus accumbens
* unit-bias: assume unit of portioning is right amount to consume
* trigger food: food that affect healthy/unhealthy food choices through presence

Social Psychology: 
* social facilitation: social situations encourage people to eat more
* impression management: control behavior to impress
* modelling: model behavior after others

Disordered Eating: 
* anorexia: self-starvation, fear of gaining weight, denial of consequences of low weight
  * do not seek treatment
  * low impulsivity
* Bulimia: periods of food deprivation, binge-eating, and purging (vomiting, fasting, laxatives, exercise)
  * more likely to seek treatment
  * tendency for impulsivity
* binge eating disorder: frequent episodes of binge-eating without purging; lack of control
* avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: aversion to food based on smell, taste, texture, brand
  * cause disturbance to satiety, weight, nutrition
* rumination syndrome: repeated regurgitation of food
  * regurgitated food re-swallowed or spit out
  * regurgitation not due to medical condition
* pica: appetite for non-nutritive substances
* other specified feeding or eating disorder; eg. purging disorder; night eating syndrome

**Sex**

* Sexual arousal: rated using self-report scales or physiological measures (heart rate, blood pressure, penile / vaginal plethysmograph)
* Sexual response cycle

Brain/hormone: 
* sexual stimulation -> activity in hypothalamus -> stimulates pituitary gland to release oxytocin
* oxytocin surges after orgasm, stays elevated for at least 5 minutes
* associate with feelings of trust - promote bonding

Gender difference
* refactory period: in men, usually not in women
* orgasm gap: men experience more frequent orgasms
* gender roles
* sexual scripts
* sex guilt: negative emotions related to violating sexual scripts or norms

Cybersex
* deindividuation: make poor choices when they feel anonymous

Sex and advertising
* sexual imagery can enhance memory for product

Orientations: 
* Sexual orientation
* Romantic orientation
* both defined by desire and personal identification, not behaviour

Common sexual orientations:
* heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, demisexual, unsure/questioning, fluid, queer, androphilic, gynephilic

Sexual minorities
- freud suggests (w/o evidence) male homosexuality results from domineering mothers / weak father figures
- may be natural
- appears to be heritable - rougly 50% of variability due to genetics (at least in men)

Gender minorities
- transgender: experiences mismatch in assigned and identified gender
- transsexual: wishes to permanently transition
- transvestite / crossdresser: enjoys wearing clothes typically worn by other gender
- drag queen: crossdressers for public performance

**Social & Achievement Goals**

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (pyramid model)
- self actualization needs: find self-fulfillment and realize one's potential
- aesthetic needs: symmetry, order, beauty
- cognitive needs: to know, understand, explore
- esteem needs: to achieve, be competent, gain approval / recognition
- belonging and love needs: to be with others, be accepted, belong
- safety needs
- physiological needs: hunger, thirst, fatigue

Social Needs
* need to belong
* prefer permanent relationships
* close long-term relationships linked with
  - ratings of happiness/life satisfaction
  - mental health
  - physical health

Love
* companionate love: involves intimacy & affection we feel for another person when we care deeply
* passionate love: intense longing for another person, accompanied by physiological arousal

Evolutionary: 
* pair-bonding promotes reproductive behaviors
* group more likely to survive
* pair-bonding derive from parent-child bonding

Terror management thoery: 
* fear of mortality promotes behaviors that reassures us (anxiety buffers)
* cultural worldview, sense of belonging, self-esteem

Achievement Needs
* drive to perform at high levels 
  * approach goal: drawn towards pleasant incentive -> happiness
  * avoidance goal: avoid unpleasant outcome -> relief

Self determination theory
* humans have needs for
  * relatedness
  * autonomy
  * competence: being able to perform task
    * self-efficacy: confidence in own ability to complete task
* individual's ability to attain wellbeing influenced by their degree of control over behaviours necessary to reach their goals
  * idea: human have inherent tendency towards growth and development, but needs to be nurtured to do so
* intrinsic motivation: desire to engage in activity because enjoyment / fullfills personal goal
* extrinsic motivation: desire to engage in activity b/c external rewards or pressures
* to preserve intrinsic motivation: 
  * avoid overjustification effect - don't reward for things they already enjoy
  * task-contigent vs. performance-contigent rewards
    * performance-contigent rewards increase interest because it conveys competence

## Emotion

Emotions are behaviours with 3 components: 
- psychological: subjectve thought/experience
- physiological: accompany patterns of neural activity and physiological arousal
- behavioural: observable behavioural expression (facial expression, muscle tension, heart rate, etc.)

When sensing emotional stimulus: 
1. Initial response within 150ms of sensing:
    * amygdala receives initial info, sends feedback to sensory areas to fir emore
    * highlights this stimulus as something to pay attention to
2. autonomic response
    * autonomic nervous system respond with sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system
3. emotional reponse (movement)
    * get ready to respond physically
    * emotional stimuli trigger increase in motor cortex activity
4. evaluation and emotion regulation
    * frontal lobe receive info from amygdala and sensory areas, decide whether emotional response is actually needed
    * generate behaviour appropriate for the situation

Theories of emotion: 
1. Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion: emotional experiences precede physiological and behavioural components
    * brain interprets situation, generates subjective feelings, feelings trigger responses in body
2. James-Lange Theory of Emotion: physiological/behavioural components precede emotional experiences
    * physiological responses come first, perceived as emotion, followed by reaction
3. Schachter & Singer: 2 factor theory of emotion
    * "physiological arrousal" occurs, use immediate environment to search for emotional cues for "conigitive labels"
    * multiple emotions can have similar physiologcical patterns
    * result in misattribution of arousal

Facial Expressions
- Cultural variations in facial expressions
- display rules: expectations about when it's appropriate to show certain emotions
- smiles: Duchenne vs non-Duchenne smiles
- affect blends: one part of face registers one emotion, another part registers a different emotion
- expressions are adaptive
  - digust: reduces airflow
  - surprise: inhale deeply, widening eye prepares us to deal with threat

Body language
- open to sexual encounter: eyebrow flash, attempt to make eye contact
- confidence, control: back straight, shoulders back
- anxiety, boredom: fidgeting

Paralanguage: nonlexical components of speech (pitch, speed, volume)


# Lecture 8: Disorder and Therapy

## Disorders

### Defining and classifying disorders

Medical model: seeing psychological conditions as set of symptoms, causes and outcomes; treatment aimed at changing physiological processes to alleviate symptoms

Biopsychosocial model: includes physiological processes as one factor in holistic view of person; involves multiple interacting systems

Behaviors vary with culture, age, gender, etc. 

Abnormal: maldaptive behaviours, thoughts, feelings-
* causing distress to you or others
* impairing day-to-day functioning
- increasing risk of injury or harm to yourself or others

DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)
* 3 sections for each disorder
  * set of symptoms, threshold for symptoms that must be met to diagnose
  * etiology (origins/causes) of symptoms
  * prognosis for how symptoms will persist or change over time
* Critisisms: 
  * categorization (vs continuum)
  * subjectivity in interpolation
  * past versions have included conditions such as homosexuality
  * substantial overlap in symptoms => common misdiagnosis
    * eg. anhedonia is symptom of depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse, PTSD, and antisocial personality disorder
  * act of labelling someone can change their outcome significantly

How to diagnose mental illness? 
* DSM
* Genetic markers
* brain scans
* indicators of neurotransmitter dysfunction

### Personality disorders

Personality disorders are behaviours that are maladaptive, distressing to oneself/others, resistant to change. 

Cluster A: odd/eccentric
1. Paranoid personality disorder: paranoia, difficult trusting others
2. Schizoid personality disorder: preference for isolation, difficult forming relationships
3. Schizotypal personality disorder: odd way of thinking/expression; difficult forming relationships

Cluster B: emotional/erratic
1. Bordelrine personality disorder: impulsive, unstable, manipulative
    * extremes between positive and negative emotions
    * unstable sense of self, insecure
    * believe to arise from severe emotional disturbances
2. Narcissistic personality disorder: insecure, inflated sense of self importance, excessive need for admiration
    * sensitive to critisism and rejection
    * self-doubt, fear of abandonment
    * little empathy for others; manipulative
3. Histrionic personality disorder: attention-seaking, flamboyant, dramatic
    * engage in risky and self-indulgent behaviour
    * highly sensitive to critisism
    * manipulative
4. Antisocial personality disorder, lack empathy, abusive, impulsive
    * psychopathy
    * disregard of others' rights
    * impose own desires onto others regardless of consequences for others
    * not motivated to change; resistent to treatment
    * show flat affect / underreactivity
    * symptoms appear in childhood (conduct disorder)

Cluster C: anxious/fearful/inhibited
1. Avoidant personality disorder: fearful of rejection, prone to isolation
2. Dependent personality disorder: insecure, difficulty making independent decisions
3. Obssessive-compulsive personality disorder: perfectionist, orderliness

 
### Dissociative disorders

Sense of separation between person and their surroundings. 

* Dissociative fatigue: period of profound episodic memory loss

* Depersonalization disorder: strong sense of surreal, feeling of being disconnected from one's body or identity/awareness

* Dissociative amnesia: severe loss of memory, usually for specific stressful event

* Dissociative identity disorder: split in identity, as though different pieces are separated from each other. Separate personalities in extreme cases (very rare - 1% of psychiatric patients)

### Anxiety Disorders

Excessive, irrational, maladaptive fear/nervousness. 

* Generalized anxiety disorder: frequently high levels of anxiety due to normal everyday stresses

* Panic disorder: occasional episodes of sudden, very intense fear (panic attacks)
* Phobia: severe, irrational fear of specific object/situation
* Social anxiety disorder: strong fear of being judged in public, often self-perpetuating

### Obssessive-Compulsive Disorder

Obsessions: unwanted, inappropriate, persistent thoughts

Compulsions: repetitive/ritualistic behaviours that calm or manage the obsessions

People with OCDs do not have much control over their obsessions / compulsions, but know they are abnormal and undesirable. 

### Mood Disorder

Major depression: prolonged periods of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, involves social withdrawal and cognitive/physical deficits; emotional numbness

Bipolar disorder: involves extremely highs and lows in mood, motivation and energy (manic episodes and depressive episodes)

### Schizophrenia

Brain disease that causes significant breaks from reality, difficulty integrating thoughts and emotions, problems with attention and memory

Rapid or gradual onset

Occur in stages: 
1. Prodromal phase: easily confused, disorganized thoughts, lose interest/motivataion in daily life, isolation, social withdrawal
2. Active phase: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized patterns of thoughts/emotions/behaviors
3. Residual phase: difficulty concentrating, low motivation, social withdrawal. 

Positive Syndromes (presence of maladaptive behaviors)
* confusion/paranoia
* inappropriate emotional reactions
* delusions
* hallucinations (alteration in perception)

Negative symptoms (absense of adaptive behaviors)
* absent/flat emotional reactions
* lack of interaction with others
* lack of motivation

Causes
* Genetic
* Neural differences
  * 20-30% larger ventricles, 2% reduction of total brain volume
  * less activity in frontal lobe, increased rate of firing in dopamine networks
  * neurodevelopmental hypothesis: adult schizophrenia is result of disrupted neurological development in womb
* overarching dysfunction
  * new theory: intellectual disability, ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder may all stem from larger syndrome of dysfunction with common causes (all have cognitive deficits in common)

Risk factors:
* stress
* marijuana use
* head injuries prior to 10
* emotional expressiveness of families

## Therapy

### Treating psychological disorders

2/3 of people with mental health issues do not seek help. 

Barriers to treatment: 
* Ambiguous nature of disorders; gender roles
* Motivation not to see themselves as mentally ill (stigma, fear)
* Lack of trust in psychiatrists/effectiveness of treatments
* Time and money

Court-ordered treatment
* compelled to enter treatment if they pose risk to themselves or others
  * court, doctor, social service agency
* Biased: People of low SES(socioeconomic status) and people of colour targeted more
* Many benefit, some find it coercive and unhelpful
  * benefit more from therapy when they are motivated to change

Historical Perspectives
* asylums: residential facilities for the mentally ill; 1500s-1900s
  * separate mentally illed from "normal"
* moral treatment: 1900s; treated with kindness
* deinstitulization: result of availability of drugs like chlorpromazine - helped many function independently
* inpatient care now focused on returning to society as soon as possible without causing harm


Evidence-based therapy: treatments tested and evaluated, ideally through experimental studies

Therapeutic alliance: relationship a therapist builds with client; influences therapy effectiveness

Self-help: people like the idea of self-help because it's cheap, easy, anonymous

Bibliotherapy: self-help book used as therapy; not very hepful usually

### psychological therapies

**Insight therapies**: dialogue between client and therapist to gain awareness and understand psychological problems
* began with Freud and psychodynamic therapies: discover and resolve unconscious conflicts
  * free association, dream analysis, resistance, transference
  * modern version emphasize on outcome research
* Humanistic-existential psychotherapy
  * focus on conscious experience
  * believe that behavior is chosen freely
  * ask client what's wrong (vs. telling them what's wrong)
  * therapist is unconditional positive; allow client to heal and become their authentic self

* Client-centred therapy (CCT) - one type of humanistic therapy
  * focuses on client solving their own problem and reaching their full potential with therapist's encouragement/guidance
  * believe that psychological problems result from other people imposing conditions of worth - therapist shows unconditional positive through empathetic, non-judgemental attention
  * Emotion-focused therapy (subtype of CCT)
    * based on expression of difficult thoughts & emotions; overcome suppression

* Ineffective in treatment of schizophrenia and severe depression, but helpful for people with panic disorder, drug dependence, borderline personality disorder, mild depression/anxiety

**Behavioural therapies**: address problem behaviours and environmental factors that trigger them
* believe that behavior is result of conditioning/learning - automatic maladaptive habits
* try to recondition clients to adopt more adaptive behavioural responses
  * aversive conditioning
  * systematic desensitization

**Cognitive-behavioural therapy**: addresses problematic thoughts & behaviors
* behavioral techniques: relaxation, exposure therapy, practicing specific skills
* cognitive techniques: cognitive restructuring, stress inoculation training
* Neuroimaging studies show that CBT change thought patterns

**Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy**: combine meditation with CBT
* emphasizes acceptance over "fixing"
* observation of oneself with curious, open, accepting, loving attitude
* building healthy relationship with yourself
* decentering- stepping back and examining yourself objectively

Behavioural therapy: treats OCD, phobias, social anxiety
CBT: treats depression, anxiety, eating disorders, OCD
MCBT: treats depression, anxiety, bipolar disorders


### biomedical therapies

Psychopharmacotherapy: use of drugs to manage or reduce symptoms

Psychotropic drugs: medications designed to alter psychological functioning; work through neurotransmitter effects

Antidepressants:
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): deactivate enzyme that breaks down serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine at synaptic cleft. Effective, many side effects
* Tricyclic antidepressants: block reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Effective, many side effects
* SSRIs: block reuptake of serotonin. Effective after some time, fewer side effects
* St. John's wort: herbal remedy; not packaged/bottled, not well regulated

Mood stabilizers:
* Lithium: salt compound that can be very effective, can be toxic for kidneys/endocrine system
* Anticonvulsants/antipsychotics: effective, associated with side effects like weight gain, nausea, fatigue

Anti-anxiety drugs
* affect activity of GABA (primary inhibitory neurotrasmitter)
* effective within minutes, last a few hours

Antipsychotic drugs
* treat symptoms of psychosis - delusions, hallucinations, severely disturbed/disorganized thoughts
* original antipsychotics had severe side effects (tardive dyskinesia)
* new wave (atypical antipsychotics) produce fewer side effects, effectiveness decreases over time

Frontal lobotomies
* frontal leucotomy: drilling holes in skull to surgically destroy brain tissue in prefrontal cortex
* frontal lobotomy: same thing, but go through eye socket instead of drilling holes
* focal lesions: surgically destroy small, targeted area of brain tissue


Electroconvulsive therapy
- pass electrical currents through brain to induce temporary seizures
- patients receive sedatives / muscle relaxants to ease discomfort
- used for severe cases of depression and bipolar disorder

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
- expose focal area of brain to powerful magnetic field to stimulate or inhibit neural activity
- 10-25 sessions
- used for schizophrenia, depression

Deep brain stimulation
- electrically stimulate specific regions of brain
- electronodes attached to thin wires, inserted into brain and routed to brain regions
- immediate relief for depression; also treat OCD
- risk: internal bleeding, infection

# Personality

## Contemporary approaches to personality

Trait: how one is most of the time

State: temporary situation that influences behaviour
* location
* association
* activity
* subjective states

Barnum effect: Tend to believe personality profile describes them well

Big Five: five-factor personality model
* openness: to ideas, perspectives, opinions, places, beliefs
  * highly open: enjoy travel, appreciative of art, think abstractly, sensitive to emotions
  * low open: practical, convention & security, dislike subtlety and complexity
* conscientiousness (dependability)
  * high: organized, self-disciplined, efficient, prudent
  * low: easy-going, fun, carefree
* extraversion
  * high: like stimulation, love companionship
  * low: need solitary time, overwhelmed by high levels of stimulation
* agreeableness: willingness to go with the flow
* neuroticism: experiences to emotion
  * high: sensitive, reactive to stress, do not regulate emotions well
  * low: secure, stable, good emotional regulators

HEXACO: 6-factor theory
* replace neuroticism with emotionality (includes attachment to others and sentimentality)
* honesty-humility
  * high: sincere, honest, modest
  * low: deceitful, greedy, self-important

Dark Traid: 3 traits that tend to be inhibited together
* narcissm: inflated sense of self-importance, attention-seeking, entitlement
* psychopathy: lack in empathy
* machiavellianism: controlling, manipulative, deceptive

Predict cheating, bullying, aggression, lying.  

Dark Tetrad
* sadism: tendency to engage in cruel, demeaning, or aggressive behaviour for pleasure or dominance
* helpful in predicting "trolling" behaviour, adolescent delinquency, unprovoked agression

Social dominance orientation: belief that
* groups of people are inherently unequal
* acceptable for some group to benefit more, some group to receive poorer treatment

Right-wing authoritarianism: characterized by
* high degree of submission to authority figures
* believe strongly in maintaining existing social order
* aggression toward group seen as legitimate targets by authority figures

How stable is personality?
* infants display temperaments, at least partly determined by genetics
  * well-adjusted: self-controlled, confident, secure
  * under-controlled: impulsive, restless, emotionally volatile
  * inhibited: socially uncomfortable, fearful of strangers
* predict neuroticism, extraversion and conscientiousness as adults
* personality change with age, and with external factors/demands


Behaviourist perspective: patterns of behaviour inluenced by situation, rather than personality

Social-Cognitive perspective: behiavour influenced by situational and psychological (personality) factor
* personality influenced by consequences in certain situations
* situations we find ourselves in determined by personality and behaviour
* reciprocal determinism: people and environments co-create each other


## Cultural perspectives

Big Five model constructed from WERID people (western, educated, industrial, rich, democratic). The model applies to most other cultural groups. 

Indigenous Chinese better described using 4-factor structure: 
* dependability (conscientiousness)
* social potency (extraversion)
* individualism (inversion of agreeableness)
* Chinese tradition: interpersonal harmony, thrift, adherence to cultural norms

Self-report responses often biased by cultural norms. For example, value is placed on modesty and self-criticism, avoid discussing strengths and successes. 

## Biological perspectives

Genes affect neurotransmitters which affect personality (eg. serotonin affects anxiety, shyness, neuroticism)

Arousal theory of extraversion: argues extraversion determined by threshold for arousal
* arousal response controlled by ascending reticular activation system
* system more reactive in introverts than extraverts
* Behavioural activation system: a "go" system, arousing one to action in pursuit of goal. Responsive to rewards and unresponsive to potential negative consequences
  * high level of BAS activation => extraversion
  * extraverts: more impulsive when rewards are possible ignore possible punishments, show stronger dopamine responses to rewards, experience more positive emotions overall
* Behavioural inhibition system: a "danger" system, arousing one to action in order to avoid negative outcomes. Associated with negative emotional responses/avoidance motivation. 
  * high levels of BIS activation related to neuroticism

## Freudian personality structure

Freud's (highly critised theories): Personality as a battleground of opposing forces: conscious vs. unconscious

Id: collection of biological drives, fuelled by libido, control urges like hunger and sex drives
* seek out pleasure with little regard for consequences
* predominant controlling force for children

Superego: learned values and moral standards
* process of internalization: evaluate ourselves based on others' values and standards

Ego: Struggling to reconcile opposing urges of id and superego
* operates according to reality principle
* tension between forces results in anxiety

Freud believes that our personality depends on
1. differing relative strengths of id, ego and supergo. 
2. how we react to anxiety produced by conflict of id and superego. 

Defence mechanisms: when ego can't resolve anxiety, avoid or minimize it (unconscious strategies). 
* denial
* displacement
* identification
* projection
* rationalization
* reaction formation
* repression
* sublimation



Personality developed as one learned to channel energy of libido into appropriate forms of self expression. If their need is not met, child becomes fixated at the stage - unable to regulate themselves or satisfy their needs at that stage. 

Psychosexual Stages: 
1. Oral stage: 0 to 1.5 year
    * Pleasure focus: mouth
    * Id desires biting and sucking, ego and superego not fully developed yet.
    * adult with oral fixation will be dependent, addictive, vulnerable to anxiety, seek to consume the world for their own emotional gain
2.  Anal Stage: 1.5 - 3 years
    * pleasure focus: anus (toilet training)
    * learning bathroom skills result in sense of competence/confidence
    * adult with fixation:
      * anal retentive: rigid, concerned with cleanliness/order, emotionally closed off
      * anal expulsive: careless, disoranized, irresponsible
3. Phallic stage (3-6 years)
    * pleasure focus: genitals
    * boys go through oedipus complex,comes with castration anxiety
    * girls go through oedipus complex first, until they realize they don't have a penis and penis envy takes over, redirect sexual interest toward fathers
    * at the end, children form healthy relationships with parents
    * fixated adults are jealous and preoccupied with sex, seduction, competitiveness, power
      * women never fully resolved penis envy, leaving them with less-developed superegos andless reliable moralities
4. Latent stage (6-13)
    * ego and superego achieved general calm
    * rich personal development
5. Genital Stage (Onset of puberty - adulthood)
    * person emerges into mature adult


## Other theories of personality

Carl Jung, early 1900s: unconscious archetypes influence personality development
* 2 segments of unconscious
  * personal unconscious: like Freud's
  * collective unconscious: separate realm that houses collective memories and mythologies of human kind, stretching into ancestral past
* archetypes: images and smbols that reflect common patterns of experience across cultures

Alfred Adler: importance of social dynamics and conscoius thought
* inferiority complex: struggle with feelings of inferiority, stemming from powerlessness during childhood
* strive to compensate by appearing competent/superior

Karent Horney: influence of parent-child conflict on personality development
* disagreed with Freudian phallocentrism
* "patriarchal power" envy instead of "penis envy"
* "womb envy" argument - drive men to succeed in other area of life


# Social Psychology

## Power of situation

Situations we find ourselves in are powerful predictors of behaviour. 

Social psychology studies the interaction between person and situation. 

Mimicry

Chamelon effect: mimic others non-consciously, especially when they like others

Social norms: rules about how all people should behave

Social roles: shared expectation about particular person
* Gender roles

Conformity: change in behavior resulting from real or imagined influence of other people
* Asch expriment: one obviously correct answer, see if participant would conform
* private acceptance: conform to others and truly believe that they're right
* public compliance: conform to others, don't necessarily believe in what they're doing or saying
* informational social influence- believe others' interpretation of sitatuion provides important information that we may lack
* normative social influence- want to be liked by others
  * act in conformist manner to gain idiosyncrasy credits, more success when introducing minor deviance later on

Minority influence: minority group member influences behavior / belief of majority
* members of minority group must be in agreement
* must present views consistently

Obedience to Authority
* conformity to commands of authority figure
* Milgram experiment: gave electric shocks to "learner" against their conscience
  * 62.5% fully obeyed, even when learner reported heart condition
  * reason for obeying: normative/informational social influence, foot-in-the-door, self-justification, aggression?
  * disobedience most likely to occur the first time learn asked to be let out
  * exposure to research enhances moral reasoning

Group Processes
* efforts are directly observed by others => social facilitation
  * increases phsyiological arousal - others make us alert and vigilant, apprehensive, or distracted
  * easier to do simple tasks, harder to do complex tasks
* efforts not directly observed => social loafing
  * more relaxed
  * easier to do something complex, harder to do something simple
  * maybe stronger in men and individualist cultures
* brainstorming: counter-productive
  * cognitive load and wasted time
  * social facilitation: hard to do something new/complex
  * creates opportunity for free riders
* groupthink: instance when maintaining group cohesiveness/harmony is more important than considering facts in realisitc manner
  * surpress alternative viewpoints

Bystander effect: greater the number of witnesses, the less likely any one of them will help (Latane & Darley, 1970)
1. Notice the event
2. Interpret event as emergency
    * pluralistic ignorance; ties to informational social influence
3. Assume responsibility
    * diffusion of responsibility
4. Know appropriate form of assistance
    * lack of knowledge/communication
5. Decide to implement help
    * fail: cost of helping perceived to be too high


## Social cognition

Automatic thinking / low-effort thinking
* habits
* emotional (impulses, values)
* eg. using heuristics, schemas and priming, embodied cognition

Controlled thinking / High-effort thinking
* logical (reflection, planning, problem solving)
* eg. counterfactuals, thought suppression, mental practice

Self-fulfilling prophecies: people's expectations influence how they behave; lead others to act in a manner consistent with expectations

Attribution theory: we form inferences about people's attributes to understand causes of others' behaviors
* internal / dispositional attribution: behavior caused by something about person
* external / situational attribution: behavior caused by situation

2-step Attribution
1. We make automatic internal attribution (infer behavior to trait)
2. Sometimes consider situational factors

* Result in Fundamental Attribution error / correspondence bias - engage only in step 1
* culture differences: step 1 is universal; step 2 more commonly taken by people in collectivist cultures (use more holistic thinking styles)

Self-Serving Bias: Attribute success to internal causes and failure to external causes 

Defensive attributions: explanations for behaviour that defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality
* belief in a just world: assumption people get what they deserve
  * blaming the victim: believe victim has control over situation
  * if they caused it, then it can't happen to me
* protect us from negative emotions
* motivate us to invest in our future

Social Categorization
* ingroup: social group to which a person identifies as a member
* outgroup: social group with which a person does not identify
* we judge members of our ingroup more positively than members of outgroup
  * self-serving proccess: positive evaluations of group = positive evaluation of self

Stereotypes: generalization about a group of people
  - cognitively-based (belief/knowledge about object)

Prejudice: hostile or negative attitude toward people in distinguishable group
  - affectively-based (feelings/emotions about object)

Discrimination: unjustified negative or harmful action toward a member of a group
  - behaviourally-based (the way attitude influences how we act)

Measuring Prejudice
* Affect Misattribution Procedure
* Implicit Associations Test

Children learn attitudes of prejudice or of acceptance from parents, peers and teachers

Reducing prejudice
* Mutual interdependence: when two groups need to depend on each other to accomplish mutual goal
* contact hypothesis: increased contacts can reduce prejudice if there is
  * mutual interdependence
  * common goal
  * equal status
  * friendly and informal setting
  * contact with multiple group members
  * social norm that promote equality and egalitarianism
* extended contact hypothesis: reduced prejudice if they know member of their own group has a close relationship with member of the other group
* common identity between two groups (eg. language)


## Attitudes and persuation

Persuasive communication: communication that advocates a point of view

Central route: high motivation and ability; reflect on merits of argument

Peripheral route: low motivation and ability; mental shortcuts and surface charateristics

Fear: induce attitude change by arousing fear; works in moderate amounts
* motivate people to pay attention
* effective when specific recommendations to enable change are included in message

Cognitive Dissonance: discomfort caused by realization that your behavior is inconsistent with attitude, or you hold two conflicting attitudes; try to reduce by: 
* change cognition to be more in line with behavior
* change behavior to be more in line with cognition
* add new cognitions

Consequences
* When we hurt someone, we sometimes dislike that person more to justify cognitive dissonance. 
* Rationalization trap: yield self-justifications that end up resulting in escalation of stupid or immoral actions

Persuasive Techniques
* Door-in-the-face technique: large request (denied) followed by a smaller one
  * reciprocity norm
  * short-lived compliance
* Foot-in-the-door technique: small request(granted) followed by larger one
  * cognitive dissonance/self-perception theory
  * lasting attitude/behaviour change
